        <h1>Thanks For Visiting!</h1>
        <p>My name is Jeremy Hoover, welcome to my GitHub page. I created this page to give whoever is interested, a little more of an in-depth look at who I am, what I do, and the ability to check out some of the projects I've been working on.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold; padding-top: 30px;">So who's this Jeremy guy?</p>
        <p>Good question! I'm pretty much a jack of all trades; a minimalist web designer, a graphic designer, a web developer, a musician, a husband, and a soon to be father. I live in the Mid-Michigan area with my wife, Molly, and when I'm not driving her crazy playing absurdly loud music in the basement with my band <a href="http://www.solarcollapse.com" target="_blank">Solar Collapse</a>, you'll probably find me upstairs obsessing over the layout and typography of whatever web project I'm working on at the time. I'm currently 12 years into my web career and looking forward to where the future takes me.
            
        <p style="font-weight: bold; padding-top: 30px;">What kind of projects have you worked on?</p>
        
        <p>I've worked on developing web applications for educational institutions, open source applications, and commercial applications.  Not all of them are publicly available as of yet, and though some are in disarray, you'll be able to view them by clicking the projects link at the top of the page.</p>
            
        <p style="font-weight: bold; padding-top: 30px;">What languages, frameworks, and applications do you use?</p>

         <p style="font-weight: bold; padding-top: 30px;">What interests do you have besides developing?</p>
        
        <p>As you can see below, I have passion (or unhealthy obsession) for music and gear. I currently own 15 guitars, 2 basses, 10 guitar amplifiers, 8 guitar cabinets, 2 bass amplifiers, 6 bass cabinets, and two drum sets. Upstairs there's a piano and hidden away in a closet, a saxophone from my time in band class.</p>
            
            <img src="http://www.jeremyhoover.net/basement.jpg" class="portfolioheader" style="margin-top: 5px;">
            
            <p>I've been in bands since I was 14 and over the past 16 years have played over 600 shows in Michigan and across the US and Canada. I'm currently the singer and guitar/bass player in a two man rock/metal outfit called Solar Collapse. If you're interested, check out the video below which is a live recording of us at Groovebox Studios in Detroit...don't worry, it's responsive.</p>

            <p>Aside from music, I have a baby boy due in August who I have a feeling will be taking up a lot of my time and interest.</p>
        
        <p style="font-weight: bold; padding-top: 30px;">Can you describe the kind of company you'd like to work for?</p>
        <ul>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">A company that understands that working from home doesn't mean I'm sitting on the couch watching TV and doing nothing.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">A company that understands that forcing me to sit in a chair from 8-5 in a shirt and tie isn't necessarily going to yield the most creative and best work.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">A company that understands that you can get burned out on a project and will allow you proper time away to get in the right headspace and get amped back up about it, without wasting your vacation time.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">A company that understands that family is always the first and foremost priority.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">A company that's doing something positive.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">A company that shares my passion for web design and development.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">A company that doesn't restrict you to a certain set of tools, platforms, and languages.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">A company where co-workers feel like friends and family.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">A company that you're proud to say you work for and feel lucky everyday to be a part of.</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-weight: bold; padding-top: 30px;">Do you think I might be a good fit for your company?</p>
        <p>Please contact me at: jhoover {at} midmich {dot} edu</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold; padding-top: 30px;">You made it all the way to the end?</p>
        <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Thank you so much more reading all of this and wading through my non-sense. I sincerely appreciate it.</p>
