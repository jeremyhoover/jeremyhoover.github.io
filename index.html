        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>My name is Jeremy Hoover and I am thrilled that you've chosen to visit my site. I created this site because I want to give prospective employers a little more of an in-depth look at who I am, what I do, and to include things that you can't always fit in a standard resume and cover letter.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold; padding-top: 30px;">So who's this Jeremy guy?</p>
        <p>Good question! I'm a Minimalist Web Designer, a Graphic Designer, a Web Developer, a musician, a husband, and a soon to be father. I live in the Mid-Michigan area with my wife, Molly, and when I'm not driving her crazy playing absurdly loud music in the basement with my band <a href="http://www.solarcollapse.com" target="_blank">Solar Collapse</a>, you'll probably find me upstairs obsessing over the layout and typography of whatever web project I'm working on at the time. I'm currently 12 years into my web career and looking forward to where the future takes me.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold; padding-top: 30px;">We're looking for a specific set of skills, do you have them?</p>
        <p>I'm willing to bet I do! You can check out my resume <a href="http://jeremyhoover.github.io/resume" target="_blank">here</a> and see how I stack up to what you're looking for below.  I feel like I should warn you, it gets pretty long.</p>

<div class="portfoliobackground" style="background: #3e393f;">

<div class="container">

<div class="container-content">
        
        
        <div style="background: #eee;padding: 20px;border-radius: 5px;margin-bottom: 30px;margin-top: 80px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;">HTML</span>
        <p>I'm amazed at all the things that are possible now with HTML5. I've been on a mission to simplify my designs and implementations by solely using HTML5 and CSS3 as much as I can. I always include a lot of comments in my HTML, keep it as clean and semantic as possible, minify, and validate to ensure it's as future proof as it can be.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="background: #eee;padding: 20px;border-radius: 5px;margin-bottom: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;">CSS</span>
            <p>Ever since I was scolded in 2003 for using a table to layout a webpage I was working on, I've been in love with CSS. Much like HTML, CSS has become so powerful in recent years and I tend to focus on using it for as much as I can, even in lieu of JS if possible. When it comes to pre-processors I took a liking to LESS right away, but have began to develop newer projects using CodeKit with SASS, COMPASS, Bourbon, and Neat.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="background: #eee;padding: 20px;border-radius: 5px;margin-bottom: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;">Javascript</span>
            <p>While my experience with Javascript has mainly seen me modify exisiting JS and jQuery scripts to my particular need, I have written a fair amount of my own recently for a web application I'm developing that includes auto-saving of a content-editable field, ajax refreshing, field-masking, and restriction of certain keyboard functions.  If I am not able to write a script from scratch, I will be able to adapt or find one that will provide an appropriate solution to any potential need that comes my way.</p>
            <p>I have gradually been integrating angular.js, knockout.js, and backbone.js into my projects, but would not consider myself a master of these frameworks just yet.
        </div>
        <div style="background: #eee;padding: 20px;border-radius: 5px;margin-bottom: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;">Adobe Creative Cloud</span>
            <p>I have been using the Adobe Creative Suite line of products for approximately 12 years and have recently moved into the arena of Adobe Creative Cloud and Adobe Edge products.  I have proficiently used these programs, most notably Photoshop and Illustrator to create, edit, and manipulate graphics for use in web/print.  I also have experience in using Fireworks and managing websites and templates with Dreamweaver.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="background: #eee;padding: 20px;border-radius: 5px;margin-bottom: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;">Responsive Layouts</span>
            <p>Every design and interface that I've produced over the last 3 years has been responsive. I've created these sites using frameworks like Bootstrap, Skeleton, Bourbon, Neat and Foundation. I've also developed my own small simple framework that I often use as a boilerplate for designs and tend to practice Mobile First. As of late, I've been focusing on creating responsive websites with HTML5 and CSS3 only. I've been weeding out frameworks and trimming the fat by trying to write as little code as possible to keep the page fast and focus on keeping all the transitions that I can, purely CSS. I believe that ALL websites should be responsive and work across all browsers and devices.  I'm always sure to test my sites in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer as well as mobile versions of Safari, Chrome, and Firefox.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="background: #eee;padding: 20px;border-radius: 5px;margin-bottom: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;">Content Management Systems</span>
            <p>I have worked in the capacity of Content Administration for over 10 years.  From the early days of maintaining Dreamweaver templates to implementing and scaling large open source Content Management Systems to developing custom plugins and applications based off popular CMS', I've really done it all.  From Homegrown to Open Source to Commercial, I've worked with Wordpress, Joomla, Concrete5, Drupal, Anchor, Sharepoint, Expression Engine, Sitebuilder, SimpleCMS, Radiant, Perch, Kirby, Pico, Monstra, and Ghost.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="background: #eee;padding: 20px;border-radius: 5px;margin-bottom: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;">Collaboration</span>
            <p>I have the ability to work autonomously or in a team setting. While I have been the sole "Web" guy in my positons for the last 5 years, I've developed an enjoyment for working with a team. I like getting other's perspectives and ideas into the mix, as well as having someone to push you to be better and learn new things.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="background: #eee;padding: 20px;border-radius: 5px;margin-bottom: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;">UI/UX</span>
            <p>Like I explained earlier, you can often find me obsessing over layout and typography when I'm working on a web project. My personal design philosophy can be summed into two words, Simplicity and Aesthetics. I think websites and application interfaces should be focused on the content, easy to use, and lightning quick, all while having a slick visual appeal. I believe the key to this is using minimalist responsive design techniques and focusing on Typography. Sometimes it all comes together and clicks quickly, sometimes I'm obsessing over line height for a week. So yeah, you could call it a passion...or an obsession.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="background: #eee;padding: 20px;border-radius: 5px;margin-bottom: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;">Continous Learning</span>
            <p>Web design and development are ever evolving entities. While I push myself to constantly learn new things everyday, it's impossible to keep up with everything. While I generally know my way around most everything HTML and CSS, there are some things that throw me for a loop. Luckily, the internet exists and I'm very adept at finding solutions to problems that I might not have the foremost knowledge on. While I might not consider myself a master of all things web, I do consider myself a master at finding and learning new things.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="background: #eee;padding: 20px;border-radius: 5px;margin-bottom: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;">QA</span>
            <p>I often go over my sites with a fine tooth comb and try to get everything as close to perfect (what I see as perfect) as I can. I'll admit that when reviewing my own work, I'll often overlook what I would consider flaws, but am quick to find them in other's work. Becuse of this, I enjoy working in a friendly team enviroment where ideas and constructive feedback can be achieved.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="background: #eee;padding: 20px;border-radius: 5px;margin-bottom: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;">Portfolio</span>
            <p>You can view some items in my portfolio <a href="http://jeremyhoover.github.io/portfolio">here</a> or by clicking on the portfolio link at the top. I've been designing, developing, and programming for over 12 years and wouldn't be able to fit all the things I've created over the years into one webpage, nor would I want to as a bulk of it would be very dated.</p>
            <p>A lot of the designs in my portfolio are things that I've created in the confines of a set of bullet points by the companies and instituions I've worked for. Because of this, I urge you to provide a sample project in which I'd be able to showcase my most recent set of design skills.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="background: #eee;padding: 20px;border-radius: 5px;margin-bottom: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;">Client Communication</span>
            <p>I very much like to be involved with constant communication with my clients. I like to get a feel of the vision in their head of what they want their site to be. Whether it involves sitting down together and going over a project from scratch or just soliciting comments about a recent revision, I feel keeping the client in the loop creates a stronger bond and makes them happier with their site in the end.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="background: #eee;padding: 20px;border-radius: 5px;margin-bottom: 80px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;font-weight: bold;">Non-Design/Coding Interests</span>
            <p>As you can see below, I have passion for music and gear. I currently own 15 guitars, 2 basses, 10 guitar amplifiers, 8 guitar cabinets, 2 bass amplifiers, 6 bass cabinets, and two drum sets. There's also a piano and a saxophone somewhere, but I'm not that proficient at those things.</p>

            <p>I've been in bands since I was 14 and over the past 15 years have played over 600 shows in Michigan and across the US and Canada. I'm curently the singer and guitar/bass player in a two man rock/metal outfit called Solar Collapse. If you're interested, check out the video below which is a live recording of us at Groovebox Studios in Detroit...don't worry, it's responsive.</p>

            <p>Aside from music, I have a baby boy due in August who I have a feeling will be taking up a lot of my time and interest.</p>
